# 2048 Number Game

## Introduction

My attempt at coding the 2048 game in Korge with no prior knowledge of Kotlin. Just a training exercise really.
I was following [this](https://blog.korge.org/korge-tutorial-writing-2048-game-step-0) but some of the guide is incorrect (previous version, maybe?) 
so I'm just messing around.
